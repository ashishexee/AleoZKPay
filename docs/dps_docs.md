Overview
The Aleo blockchain allows users to execute programs on-chain while preserving the privacy of the inputs and outputs to those functions. This enables applications like private value transfers, private identity verification, private swaps and more.

Building these proofs completely privately is traditionally done on a local device; however, this process often takes a significant amount of time.

Delegated proving allows users to delegate generation of proofs to an external service which can produce proofs quickly and privately within a Trusted Execution Environment that ensures no one but the caller knows the content of the proof.

Generally this works in the following way:

Build a proving request (program, function, inputs, fee settings, broadcast flag).
Submit it to the delegated prover in encrypted form, which is only decrypted within a TEE.
The proving service submits the transaction to the blockchain.
Usage Guide
This guide shows how to access the delegated proving service with JS/TS either using the Provable SDK or custom TS/JS code.

Credentials and authentication
The Delegated Proving Service (DPS) is hosted behind the Provable API at https://api.provable.com/v2.

To authenticate you need:

API key and consumer ID — Obtain these by registering a consumer (e.g. POST {baseUrl}/consumers). See Provable API documentation for details.
JWT — Used for authenticated endpoints. The SDK refreshes the JWT by calling POST https://api.provable.com/jwts/{consumerId} with header X-Provable-API-Key: <apiKey>. You can also obtain and cache the JWT yourself and pass it in when using the SDK or your own client.
The Delegated prover endpoints typically require a JWT in the Authorization header; the SDK handles JWT refresh when both apiKey and consumerId are configured.

Base URLs
The network client uses the host you provide (e.g. https://api.provable.com/v2) for general API access. The prover (DPS) base URL is https://api.provable.com/prove/{network} (e.g. https://api.provable.com/prove/mainnet or https://api.provable.com/prove/testnet). The paths /pubkey and /prove/encrypted are relative to the prover base. You can override the prover base with the url option when calling submitProvingRequest (e.g. url: "https://api.provable.com/prove/testnet"), or set proverUri when constructing the AleoNetworkClient.

Delegated Proving Service (DPS)
When using the delegated proving service, users must obtain a Provable API key. They are then able to submit Proving requests in encrypted form to the delegated proving service.

Flow (encrypted proving)
Client must obtain an API key or JWT from the provable API.
Client requests an ephemeral X25519 public key from the prover: GET {proverBase}/pubkey.
Client builds a proving request (authorization, optional fee authorization, broadcast flag), encrypts it via a libsodium cryptobox (e.g. with encryptProvingRequest), and sends it to: POST {proverBase}/prove/encrypted with { "key_id": string, "ciphertext": string }.
Prover decrypts in a secure environment, runs the proof, and returns a transaction and broadcast_result (if the request asked for broadcast). The client may submit the transaction themselves or use the broadcast result.

POST /prove/encrypted { key_id, ciphertext }
{ "transaction": object, "broadcast_result": { "status", ... } }
Routes
All paths are relative to the prover base URL (e.g. https://api.provable.com/prove/mainnet or https://api.provable.com/prove/testnet).

Path	Method	Purpose	Request body	Response
/pubkey	GET	Ephemeral public key for encrypted proving	—	{ "key_id": string, "public_key": string }
/prove/encrypted	POST	Submit proving request (encrypted)	{ "key_id": string, "ciphertext": string }	Same as /prove on success
Authentication (e.g. JWT in Authorization, cookies for session) is required for Provable’s API. In Node, you may need to forward the set-cookie header from the /pubkey response to the /prove/encrypted request so the prover can associate the two calls.

Building a proving request
A proving request consists of:

An authorization for the program function (and inputs) the user wants to run.
An optional fee authorization (e.g. credits.aleo fee_public / fee_private) to pay for the execution—or none
when using a fee master (useFeeMaster: true).
A broadcast flag indicating whether the prover should submit the resulting transaction to the network.
The SDK builds this in two stages:

Authorize the main function (program, function name, inputs, private key, optional edition). The base fee is estimated from this authorization.
Optionally authorize the fee (execution ID, base fee, priority fee, fee record)—unless the program is a fee-related credits.aleo function or useFeeMaster is true, in which case no fee authorization is attached.
So when you call programManager.provingRequest(options), the SDK resolves the program (and imports, edition) if needed, resolves the fee record when not using the fee master, then calls the WASM layer to build the authorization and optional fee authorization and wraps them in a ProvingRequest. You can then submit that object (or its string form) to the prover.

Using the SDK
Build a proving request with ProgramManager.provingRequest(options). Options include programName, functionName, inputs, privateFee, priorityFee, broadcast, useFeeMaster, privateKey, programSource, programImports, edition, etc. The SDK fetches the program and edition from the network if not provided.
Submit with the network client:
submitProvingRequest(options) — Resolves with the proving response on success; throws on HTTP 400, 500, 503 (and retries on 500/503).
submitProvingRequestSafe(options) — Returns a result object { ok, data } or { ok: false, status, error } so you can handle errors without try/catch.
Options for submit include provingRequest (the built request or its string), url (prover URL), apiKey, consumerId, jwtData, and dpsPrivacy: true to use the encrypted flow (GET /pubkey, encrypt, POST /prove/encrypted). When using the Provable API, pass apiKey and consumerId in the submit options (or pass jwtData) so the SDK can refresh the JWT.

Example: build and submit with the SDK (encrypted)

import {
  Account,
  AleoKeyProvider,
  ProgramManager,
  NetworkRecordProvider,
  AleoNetworkClient,
} from "@provablehq/sdk/mainnet.js";

const host = "https://api.provable.com/v2";
const account = new Account({ privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY });
const networkClient = new AleoNetworkClient(host);
const keyProvider = new AleoKeyProvider();
const recordProvider = new NetworkRecordProvider(account, networkClient);
keyProvider.useCache(true);

const programManager = new ProgramManager(host, keyProvider, recordProvider);
programManager.setAccount(account);

// Build the proving request (fee is estimated; optional useFeeMaster)
const provingRequest = await programManager.provingRequest({
  programName: "credits.aleo",
  functionName: "transfer_public",
  priorityFee: 0,
  privateFee: false,
  inputs: [
    "aleo1vwls2ete8dk8uu2kmkmzumd7q38fvshrht8hlc0a5362uq8ftgyqnm3w08",
    "10000000u64",
  ],
  broadcast: false,
});

// Submit with encryption (DPS privacy); pass apiKey and consumerId in options
const networkClient = programManager.networkClient;
const response = await networkClient.submitProvingRequest({
  provingRequest,
  dpsPrivacy: true,
  apiKey: process.env.PROVABLE_API_KEY,
  consumerId: process.env.PROVABLE_CONSUMER_ID,
});

console.log("Transaction ID:", response.transaction?.id);
console.log("Broadcast status:", response.broadcast_result?.status);

Example: handle errors without throwing

const result = await networkClient.submitProvingRequestSafe({
  provingRequest,
  dpsPrivacy: true,
  apiKey: process.env.PROVABLE_API_KEY,
  consumerId: process.env.PROVABLE_CONSUMER_ID,
});

if (result.ok) {
  const { transaction, broadcast_result } = result.data;
  // use transaction, broadcast_result
} else {
  console.error(result.status, result.error.message);
}

Using custom JavaScript
You can build the proving request with the SDK (or another tool) and then submit it with your own HTTP client, using the SDK only for encryption.

Step 1: Get ephemeral public key

Use the same credentials you will use for the proving POST (e.g. JWT). In Node, capture the set-cookie header from the response so you can send it with the next request if the prover uses session cookies.

const proverBase = "https://api.provable.com/prove/mainnet"; // or .../prove/testnet
const headers: Record<string, string> = {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "Authorization": jwt,
};

const pubkeyRes = await fetch(`${proverBase}/pubkey`, {
  method: "GET",
  headers,
  credentials: "include",
});
if (!pubkeyRes.ok) throw new Error(`Pubkey failed: ${await pubkeyRes.text()}`);

const pubkey = await pubkeyRes.json();
const cookie = typeof process !== "undefined" && process.versions?.node
  ? pubkeyRes.headers.get("set-cookie")
  : undefined;

Step 2: Build and encrypt the proving request

Build the request with the SDK (e.g. programManager.provingRequest(...)) or from a serialized string. Then encrypt it.

import { encryptProvingRequest } from "@provablehq/sdk/mainnet.js";
import { ProvingRequest } from "@provablehq/sdk/mainnet.js";

const provingRequest = await programManager.provingRequest({ ... });
const ciphertext = encryptProvingRequest(pubkey.public_key, provingRequest);

If you already have the request as a string: ProvingRequest.fromString(provingRequestString) before encrypting.

Step 3: POST encrypted proving request

const res = await fetch(`${proverBase}/prove/encrypted`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": jwt,
    ...(cookie ? { Cookie: cookie } : {}),
  },
  credentials: "include",
  body: JSON.stringify({ key_id: pubkey.key_id, ciphertext }),
});

const text = await res.text();
let body: unknown;
try {
  body = JSON.parse(text);
} catch {
  body = { message: text || `${res.status} error` };
}

if (res.ok) {
  const { transaction, broadcast_result } = body as { transaction: any; broadcast_result: any };
  return { ok: true, data: body };
}
const message = typeof (body as any)?.message === "string" ? (body as any).message : text;
return { ok: false, status: res.status, error: { message } };

Full custom example: encrypted delegated proving

import { encryptProvingRequest } from "@provablehq/sdk/mainnet.js";
import { ProvingRequest } from "@provablehq/sdk/mainnet.js";

const isNode =
  typeof process !== "undefined" && process.versions != null && process.versions.node != null;

async function submitProvingRequestEncrypted(
  proverBase: string,
  provingRequest: ProvingRequest,
  jwt: string
): Promise<
  | { ok: true; data: { transaction: any; broadcast_result: any } }
  | { ok: false; status: number; error: { message: string } }
> {
  const headers: Record<string, string> = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": jwt,
  };

  const pubkeyRes = await fetch(`${proverBase}/pubkey`, {
    method: "GET",
    headers,
    credentials: "include",
  });
  if (!pubkeyRes.ok) {
    return {
      ok: false,
      status: pubkeyRes.status,
      error: { message: await pubkeyRes.text() },
    };
  }
  const pubkey = await pubkeyRes.json();
  const cookie = isNode ? pubkeyRes.headers.get("set-cookie") : undefined;

  const ciphertext = encryptProvingRequest(pubkey.public_key, provingRequest);

  const res = await fetch(`${proverBase}/prove/encrypted`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      ...headers,
      ...(cookie ? { Cookie: cookie } : {}),
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ key_id: pubkey.key_id, ciphertext }),
    credentials: "include",
  });

  const text = await res.text();
  let body: any;
  try {
    body = JSON.parse(text);
  } catch {
    body = { message: text || `${res.status} error` };
  }

  if (res.ok) return { ok: true, data: body };
  return {
    ok: false,
    status: res.status,
    error: { message: body?.message ?? text },
  };
}

You can add retries for 500/503 and JWT refresh when the token is expired.

Quick reference
Step	GET	POST	Encrypt (SDK)
Prove (encrypted)	/pubkey	/prove/encrypted with { key_id, ciphertext }	encryptProvingRequest(publicKey, provingRequest)
Prove (unencrypted)	—	/prove with ProvingRequest string	—
One key per request: Use the key_id from the same GET response in the corresponding POST. For retries, fetch a new key from /pubkey.
Encryption: Use the SDK’s encryptProvingRequest (from @provablehq/sdk); ciphertext is base64. The same wire format can be implemented with libsodium if you do not use the SDK.
Best practices
Prefer encrypted flow for production so proving requests are only decrypted inside the service’s secure environment.
Handle prover errors explicitly: Use submitProvingRequestSafe when you want to branch on status (400 vs 500/503) without try/catch; use submitProvingRequest when you want the SDK to throw after retries.
JWT and cookies: For DPS with the Provable API, supply apiKey and consumerId (or a valid jwtData) so the SDK can refresh the JWT. In Node, forward the /pubkey response cookie to /prove/encrypted when the prover uses session cookies.
Fee master: When the prover or your deployment supports a fee master, set useFeeMaster: true in proving request options so no fee authorization is built; the prover pays the fee on your behalf.
Record scanner with ProgramManager: You can pass a Record Scanner (or any RecordProvider) into ProgramManager. The manager will then use it to resolve fee records (and inputs) when building executions or proving requests, so you do not have to fetch fee records manually.
