1. One submission per person/team

You may not submit multiple projects, either individually or as a part of a team or multiple teams.  Those who attempt to subvert this rule via creating multiple Github accounts or something of the like will be detected and banned from future consideration in the Buildathon

2. Projects must have a functional frontend AND have non-trivial Leo code be deployed on at least the Aleo Testnet

In order to better respect the judges' time, your project must have a live frontend that we can go in and test.  In particular, the must be some way from your frontend to perform a non-trivial interactation with your contract that is deployed on Testnet/Mainnet.  Additionally, your program deployed onchain must be something other than the default program created by `leo new`.

3. Projects must provide a descriptive and concise update through the Akindo platform

Even if you're submitting for the first time, please give a concise description of what your worked on this wave, and please specify which features you haven't finished yet so we have context on what to look for.

4.  Projects must take advantage of Aleo's core tooling

If your project is making any use of payments, you must integrate and utilize the types and methods in either the native `credits.aleo`, or the USDCx or USAD stablecoin programs.  Furthermore, all projects will be required to integrate Shield Wallet at a minimum.  Shield Wallet is a significant improvement on previous wallet experiences on Aleo, and generally makes the development, testing, and user experience much better.

5.  No AI Slop!

While this one is generally hard to enforce, we reserve the right to automatically disqualify any projects that appear to be low-effort, mostly AI-generated submissions.  

NOTE: this does not mean that you can't use AI.  Tools like Claude Code and GPT-Codex can be very useful for accelerating the development process.  However, we do not want low-effort submissions that look complex on the surface but don't have any serious depth or intention to them.
